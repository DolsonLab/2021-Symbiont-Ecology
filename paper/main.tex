\section{Introduction}

% Outline:
% - Why we care about this general topic (understanding microbiome is important for health, etc.)
% - What we know so far (Anya's paper, lit review)
% - Why it's not obvious what will happen when we add symbiont ecology and why it's important to answer that question

\section{Methods}

% Outline:
% - Summary of how Symbulation works (reference previous papers so people can read more if they want)
% - Summary of any changes we made to Symbulation
% - Describe what experimental conditions we tested and why

\section{Results and Discussion}

% Describe what happened
% Discuss why that happened and how it connects to other stuff we know

\section{Conclusion}

% What are our big picture findings and why do the matter?

% Here's an example of adding a figure
% \begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=2.1in,angle=-90]{figures/fig_name_here.png}
% \caption{Caption here}
% \label{fig_label_here}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

% Here's an example of adding an equation
% \begin{eqnarray}
% v\sim\sqrt{D\Delta\epsilon}\;, \label{eq4}
% \end{eqnarray}
